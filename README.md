# MusicGenerator

## Overview
MusicGenerator is a project designed to generate music using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is trained on a dataset of musical pieces and generates new compositions based on the learned patterns.

## Features
- LSTM-based music generation
- Pre-trained model for generating MIDI files
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IncriwerBoy/MusicGenerator.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

2. Use the interface to generate new music.

## Files
- 'app.py': Contains the Streamlit app code.
- 'helper.py': Text processing utilities.
- 'weights.weights.h5': Weights of the trained model
